This was originally supposed to be an online multiplayer fighting game similar to Brawlhalla, with the added twist that it is browser based.

Well that did not happen.

Fast forward to 2022: I have learnt that making fast paced multiplayer game is hard.
Turn based stuff? Okay.
Real-time games? OMFG!

Why is this repo still alive then?
Well, I might revisit this project someday. Not to create a web based Brawlhalla, of course. May be something akin to creature capture games or farming games - with some multiplayer elements.

Let's see what the future holds! 🤞
