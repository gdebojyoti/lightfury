# Project Lightfury

This was originally supposed to be an online multiplayer fighting game similar to Brawlhalla, with the added twist that it is browser based. 🤘

Well that did not happen. 🤣

Fast forward to 2022: I have learnt that making fast paced multiplayer game is hard. 😭

Turn based stuff? Okay. 👍
Real-time games? OMFG! 🙀

Why is this repo still alive then?
Well, I might revisit this project someday.
Not to create a web based Brawlhalla, of course.
May be something akin to creature capture games or farming games - with some multiplayer elements. 🙂

Let's see what the future holds! 🤞
